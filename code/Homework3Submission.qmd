# Problem 1: Personal data

## a. Data Summarizing 

[I am summarizing my data by taking the mean number of steps taken for each sleep category: less than 6 hours, 6–7 hours, 7–8 hours, 8–9 hours, 9–10 hours, and 10 or more hours, and comparing my daily step counts across different sleep durations. I sleep less when I have to get up early and be out of the house, so I think I will walk more compared to the days I am able to sleep in.]
