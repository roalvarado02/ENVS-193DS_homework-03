# Problem 1: Personal data

## a. Data Summarizing 

[I am summarizing my data by taking the mean number of steps taken for each sleep category: less than 7 hours, 7–8 hours, 8–9 hours, 9–10 hours, and 10 or more hours, and comparing my daily step counts across different sleep durations. I sleep less when I have to get up early and be out of the house, so I think I will walk more compared to the days I am able to sleep in.]

## b. Vizualization

```{r}
# Set ggplot theme
theme_set(theme_bw())

# Clean and categorize data
my_data <- my_data |> 
  clean_names() |> 
  #making columns based on sleep category
  mutate(sleep_category = cut(
    sleep_hours,
    breaks = c(-Inf, 7, 8, 9, 10, Inf),
    labels = c("Less than 7", "7–8", "8–9", "9–10", "10 or more"),
    right = FALSE)) #includes the lesser value

# Create plot and input x and y axis values from table
ggplot(my_data, 
       aes(x = sleep_category, 
           y = exercise_steps, 
           color = sleep_category)) +
  
  # Add jitter layer
  geom_jitter(shape = 1, height = 0, width = 0.2, alpha = 0.6) +
  
  # Colored filled mean points
  stat_summary(
    geom = "point", 
    fun = mean, 
    size = 4, 
    aes(color = sleep_category)) +

  # Label x and y axis and title
  labs(x = "Sleep Duration Category",
       y = "Number of Steps",
       title = "Daily Steps vs Sleep Duration Category") +

  # Remove legend 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +

  # Manually set color palette
  scale_color_manual(values = c(
    "Less than 7" = "red",
    "7–8" = "orange",
    "8–9" = "hotpink",
    "9–10" = "green",
    "10 or more" = "blue"
  )) 


```


## c. Caption

[Figure 1 - Less than 9 hours of sleep have higher step counts compared to sleeping 9 or more hours.

Scatterplot showing the relationship between categorized sleep duration and number of daily steps taken. Each open circle represents a singular day's step count, colored by sleep duration category (total n = 35). Sleeping less than 9 hours is colored red, sleeping 7-8 hours is colored orange, sleeping 8-9 hours is colored hot pink, sleeping 9-10 hours is colored green, and sleeping 10 or more hours is colored blue. The larger filled dots indicate the average steps for each group. Data was collected by self recording hours of sleep and tracking through phone step count.]


## d. Table presentation


```{r}
# Summarize mean steps by sleep category
summary_table <- my_data |> 
  group_by(sleep_category) |> 
  summarise(Average_Steps = round(mean(exercise_steps), 1)) |> 
  arrange(factor(sleep_category, levels = c("Less than 7", "7–8", "8–9", "9–10", "10 or more")))

# Create GT table
summary_table |> 
  gt() |> 
  # labeling columns and title
  cols_label(
    sleep_category = "Sleep Duration Category",
    Average_Steps = "Average Steps"
  ) |> 
  tab_header(
    title = "Average Daily Steps by Sleep Duration"
  )

```


# Problem 2: Affective visualization 

## a. Describe in words what an affective visualization could look like for your personal data

An affective visualization of my personal data of comparing hours of sleep to daily steps could take the form of a color-coded spiral. Each loop of the spiral represents a day and the color intensity of the sprial varies on sleep quantity (darker colors for more sleep and lighter ones for less sleep). The thickness of each spiral depends on the amount of steps taken that day (thicker lines mean more steps, thinner lines are less).

## b. Create a sketch of your idea

## c. Make a draft of your visualization



## d. Write an artist statement

This piece shows the relationship between hours of sleep compared to daily steps taken by showing each spiral as time passing through one day, color as amount of sleep, and thickness and amount of steps taken. The design was inspired by David Sasson's sleep cycle pattern visualization which also tracked cyclical sleep patterns. It is done on paper with watercolor, pencil, and a mixture of freehand painting and spiral measurements. 


# Problem 3: A Statistical Critique 

## a. Revisit and summarize

The authors used the Kruskal-Wallis Test to investigate whether two dominant nurse plants (Artemisia sieberi and Stipa arabica) influence taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity during different stages of land abandonment in a degraded arid landscape.

## b. Visual clarity

The authors visually represented their statistics in the figures in a clear and concise manner. The boxplots clearly labeled the different categories they were measuring (species richness, Shannon's diversity, functional diversity, and phylogenetic diversity). Error bars indicate the 5th and 95th percentiles. The blue boxes signified the presence of nurse species and the red boxes signified the absence of nurse species. The x-axis labels which groups where the control, recently abandoned, and old abandoned. The y-axis is the mean pairwise distance (MPD), though it is difficult to tell what exactly is being measured. 

## c. Aesthetic clarity

The authors poorly handled their visual clutter. While the variables were measured and sorted clearly, the words were very blurry on the x and y axis and the titles. It was hard to tell what the y-axis was measuring and what the different colors represented or where the error bars were located. 

## d. Recommendations
